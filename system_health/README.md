**System Health & Monitoring**

Here is a scalable dashboard created in order to streamline the monitoring of both the health of VOOM's software 
infrastructure and the growth of their company.

Tornado was used as a python web framework.
Javascript was used to make API queries and to construct the relevant dashboard elements.
Information was pulled from SkyWatch's Azure database and from their ELK stack.

The design of the site was based on the [Light Bootstrap Dashboard template](https://demos.creative-tim.com/light-bootstrap-dashboard/).
